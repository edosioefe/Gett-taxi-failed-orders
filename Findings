FINDINGS: Most failed order are coming from reading city centre; especially near the train station

Huge amount of failed oreder are coming from the early hours of the morning (Between 7am-9am); most caancelations from this period are due to a driver not being assigned(customers in a rush in the morning with going to work/education) Average ETA during this period is also very high; likely due to busy time/rush hour. Clear solution is to have more driver working during this period, can offer drivers higher pay rate for incentive.

Average cancellation time is higher when driver is assigned; customers are willing to wait longer for taxi to come as long as a driver is assigned
